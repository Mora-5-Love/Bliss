0.  The public key polynomial 'a' should not be stored in NTT form
    since that forces a dependency on a particular choice of NTT.


2. The NTT implementation should be isolated from the bliss b
   implementation by a minimal API, and then we can test various
   versions via this API and dynamic libraries.

   Something like: (?)
   
typedef void* ntt_state_t;

bool init_ntt_state(ntt_state_t* state, int32_t q, int32_t n);

void delete_ntt_state(ntt_state_t* state);

void multiply(int32_t *result, const int32_t *lhs, const int32_t *rhs, uint32_t n, const ntt_state_t* state);

Talk more with BD about this once he has finished his talk.

3. Debugging code should be removed and the code should get a
   spring clean.


4. Implement a constant-time modQ operation. Use it systematically.


5. Finish the eBATS api (bliss_b.h).
