Q1: We should come to some rational explanation of why most of
    the bliss_b_params are int32_t rather than uint32_t, or change them
    to uint32_t.

Q2: See query about M in bliss_b_signatures.c



0.  The public key polynomial 'a' should not be stored in NTT form
    since that forces a dependency on a particular choice of NTT.


1. The sampler should be less entwined with the bliss b internals.


2. The NTT implementation should be isolated from the bliss b
   implementation by a minimal API, and then we can test various
   versions via this API and dynamic libraries.

   Something like: (?)
   
typedef void* ntt_state_t;

bool init_ntt_state(ntt_state_t* state, int32_t q, int32_t n);

void delete_ntt_state(ntt_state_t* state);

void multiply(int32_t *result, const int32_t *lhs, const int32_t *rhs, uint32_t n, const ntt_state_t* state);


3. Debugging code shuld be removed and the code should get a
   spring clean.
